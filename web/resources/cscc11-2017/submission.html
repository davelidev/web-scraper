      Assignment Submission Procedure </h2>
    <p>
      Theoretical problem sets will be handed in on paper. They may be
      hand written or done in any conventional word processor.
      Solutions to programming (Matlab) problems will be submitted both
      on paper and electronically. Paper copies must be submitted to the
      CSCC11 assignment drop box on the CS wing of the 4th floor of the
      IC building.
    </p>
    <p>Follow these steps when submitting your electronic copy
      (from the mathlab machines):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> First ftp all of the files that are required for your
        assignment (Matlab scripts and function files). Then tar the
        directory, and call the result A[n].tar where n is either
        1, 2, 3, or 4 (for the four assignments). </li>
      <li> Submit all of your tar file using the command <font
          color="#0000ff"> submit -N assignmentname cscc11f15 filename </font>
        where <font color="#0000ff"> assignmentname </font> is A1 for
        assignment #1 etc., and <font color="#0000ff"> filename </font>
        is the name of the tarfile to be submitted (A1.tar for
        assignment 1). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Further documentation on the submit command may be found by
      typing <font color="#0000ff"> man submit </font>. </p>
